                    <h2>September 5, 1946</h2>

                    <h2>1954 - 1958</h2>
                    <p>At the age of eight, Mercury was sent to study at St. Peter's School, a British-style boarding school for boys, in Panchgani near Bombay, and at the age of 12, he formed a school band, the Hectics, and covered rock and roll artists such as Cliff Richard and Little Richard.</p>

                    <h2>1969</h2>
                    <p>After first studying art at Isleworth Polytechnic in West London, Mercury studied graphic art and design at Ealing Art College, graduating with a diploma.</p>
                    <p>Following graduation, Mercury joined a series of bands and sold second-hand Edwardian clothes and scarves in Kensington Market in London with Roger Taylor.</p>
                    <p>He joined Liverpool-based band Ibex, later renamed Wreckage, which played "very Hendrix-style, heavy blues". When this band failed to take off, he joined an Oxford-based band, Sour Milk Sea, but by early 1970 this group had broken up as well.</p>

                    <h2>1970 - 1971</h2>
                    <p>Mercury teamed up with guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor, to become lead singer of their band Smile. They were joined later on by bassist John Deacon.</p>
                    <p>Despite the reservations of the other members and Trident Studios, the band's initial management, Mercury chose the name "Queen" for the new band.</p>
                    <p>He later said, "It's very regal obviously, and it sounds splendid. It's a strong name, very universal and immediate. I was certainly aware of the gay connotations, but that was just one facet of it."</p>
                    <p>At about the same time, he legally changed his surname, Bulsara, to Mercury.</p>

                    <h2>Relationships</h2>
                    <p>In the early 1970s, Mercury had a long-term relationship with Mary Austin, whom he met through guitarist Brian May.</p>
                    <p>In the mid-1970s, he had begun an affair with David Minns, an American record executive at Elektra Records.</p>
                    <p>In December 1976, Mercury told Austin of his sexuality, which ended their romantic relationship.</p>
                    <p>Mercury and Austin remained friends through the years, with Mercury often referring to her as his only true friend.</p>
                    <p>By 1985, he began another long-term relationship with Irish-born hairdresser Jim Hutton, whom he referred to as his husband.</p>

                    <p>Mercury called Queen's manager Jim Beach to his Kensington home to prepare a public statement, which was released the following day:</p>
                    <p class="i">"Following the enormous conjecture in the press over the last two weeks, I wish to confirm that I have been tested HIV positive and have AIDS. I felt it correct to keep this information private to date to protect the privacy of those around me. However, the time has come now for my friends and fans around the world to know the truth and I hope that everyone will join with me, my doctors and all those worldwide in the fight against this terrible disease. My privacy has always been very special to me and I am famous for my lack of interviews. Please understand this policy will continue."</p>
